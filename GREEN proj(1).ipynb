    "## AUTOMATIC CROP DISEASE DETECTION SYSTEM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "Most farmers are faced with problems like, low production as well as low profits due to disease attack on the plants. They are also faced with the problem of disease identification in plants as well as proper treatments for them. Currently, the farmers determine the type of disease manually. The errors might occur in order to determine the type of diseases. These farmers also must spend a lot of time to detect the type of disease and this reason they tend to waste time which they can channel in cultivation of more plants. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "The objectives to achieve in this project are: \n",
    "i) To develop the prototype of disease detection system.\n",
    " ii) To detect the plant diseases by using image processing.\n",
    "   iii) To apply image processing technique to analyze the pattern of plant disease.\n",
    "      iv) To produce possible treatments to the plant diseases.\n",
